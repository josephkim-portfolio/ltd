     Hello! My name is Joe, and I'm a student in the Information Science and Learning Technologies program at MU. I reside in Southern California, where there are only 2.5 seasons (we don't have a true winter, but we have half a Fall!). My web development experience includes using WYSIWYG platforms like Wix and Squarespace, but I have little HTML and coding experience. I hope to learn HTML, CSS, and the basics of more advanced coding, like JavaScript and JQuery. It seems like this course will be covering all of this, which I'm glad for! Although my goal is not to be a professional web developer, it would be great to learn how to add, manipulate, and adjust code when using WYSIWYG platforms.

     My hobbies include watching a good drama, enjoying indie and mainstream films, and listening to Audibles and podcasts.
