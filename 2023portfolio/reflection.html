            <p class="FirstLetter font-para">
                I began my program as a part-time student in Fall 2016 with the goal of changing my career. Having worked in higher education for a number of years in various roles, I learned of a role that combined analysis, research, and leveraging best practices from the learning sciences to craft optimized learning experiences. Curiosity led to commitment, and I’m happy that I was privileged with the opportunity to switch into this career while pursuing studies at the University of Missouri.
            </p>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                In reflection, the program of study blended well competencies in analysis and project management, an array of design courses, and curriculum/pedagogical best practices. My learnings provided foundational knowledge in curriculum development, design, and in authoring tools. I appreciated most the balance between theory and practical skills to design, author, and create. The program’s portfolio and artifact culmination evidences this balance of foundational theory and practical, career-relevant deliverables.The endeavor of crafting meaningful learning experiences is a genuine love of mine, and my learnings throughout the Learning Technologies and Design program developed my knowledge and skillset in the field of instructional design.

            <h4 class="ChangeClassGreen FirstLetter font-header">PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN</h4>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                My experiences in Instructional Design has mainly been in Higher Education academic contexts. I am interested in developing curriculum in the context of workplace Learning and Development. Additionally, I aim to broaden and deepen design and authoring skills in applications relevant to the field. Below entail my next professional development goals:
              <ul>
                <li>Competency Based Education - My LTD program emphasized the importance of well-defined learning outcomes and acceptable evidences (conveyed by the Understanding by Design approach). A outcomes-oriented model that is growing in popularity in K-12 and Higher Education settings is the Competency Based Education (CBE) model. I am interested in learning how a CBE model can apply in Higher Education and Learning and Development workplace learning contexts.
                  <li>Articulate Storyline - Learning Adobe Captivate in my program was extremely practical and rewarding. An alternative authoring tool, Articulate Storyline, is a popular option with robust design features that I would like to learn and compare with Adobe Captivate.
                    <li>Articulate Rise 360 - As part of the Articulate suite, Rise 360 is a web-based authoring tool that allows rapid-development of learning solutions, as it is template-based. Additionally, the platform highly values accessible features in its design, which is extremely needed for equitable learning in Higher Education and workplace settings.
                      <li>Adobe Illustrator - At the end of my program, I find that graphic design skills is relevant to a variety of tasks for an Instructional Designer. I aim to learn Adobe Illustrator to utilize and manipulate visual character and objects to create scenarios for scenario-based e-learning.
