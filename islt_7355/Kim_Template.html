            <h3>About Me</h3>  
            <p>My name is Joseph Kim, and I am a student in the Information Science and Learning Technologies program at the University of Missouri.<br><br>
                My educational goals seek to develop my competencies in the field of instructional design in higher education. I aspire to collaborate
                with online instructors to develop meaningful and creative online learning experiences for students. This includes helping teachers
                create online class activities, projects, quizzes, and homework. Additionally, I seek to utilize my graphic design, video editing, and 
                Adobe Captivate skills to enhance the multimedia aspects of online classes.</p>
