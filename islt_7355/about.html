        <h2>About</h2>  
        <p>My name is Joseph Kim, and I am a student in the Information Science and Learning Technologies program at the University of Missouri.<br><br>
            My educational goals seek to develop my competencies in the field of instructional design in higher education. I aspire to collaborate
            with instructors to develop meaningful and creative online learning experiences for students. This includes helping teachers create 
            engaging content, scaffolded activities, and aligned assessments. Additionally, I seek to utilize my graphic design, video editing, and 
            Adobe Captivate skills to enhance the multimedia aspects of online learning.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>“Education at its best... is about empowerment, liberation, transcendence, about renewing<br/>  the vitality of life. It is about finding and claiming ourselves and our place in the world.”</p>
        <p>Parker Palmer, cited by Bell Hooks in <em>Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope</em></p>
