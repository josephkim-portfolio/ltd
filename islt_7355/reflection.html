            <h4 class="ChangeClassGreen FirstLetter font-header">THE ROAD TO INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN</h4>
            <p class="FirstLetter font-para">
                The endeavor of crafting meaningful learning experiences for online students is a genuine love of mine. The strengths I bring to the field of Instructional Design in higher education have been cultivated through my various career experiences. My experiences as an Instructional Designer, an Academic Advisor, and as a Lead ESL Instructor have especially developed my skills.
            </p>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                In my current role as an Instructional Designer at Azusa Pacific University, I collaborate with subject matter experts to design clear, connective, cumulative, and career-oriented learning experiences for undergraduate and graduate online programs. I take faculty from the blueprint stage to a published course within the Canvas LMS. My experiences have sharpened my skills in setting up efficient processes for faculty, ensuring learning outcome alignment, organizing a ton of content, ADA compliance, and anticipating student and faculty confusion.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="ChangeClassGreen FirstLetter font-header">COACHING DIVERSE ONLINE STUDENTS</h4>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                My work at the University of Southern California and at Los Angeles Pacific University is where I gained much insight into how online learners flourish and where they falter. My duties included supporting students pursuing primarily online degrees. My support ranged from LMS navigation, leading online new student orientations, and coaching students from admission to graduation. The students I supported included international students, active military students, and parents who worked full-time. These valuable on-the-ground experiences of how students can succeed and struggle in face-to-face and online courses are experiences I bring to my work as an Instructional Designer.
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="ChangeClassGreen FirstLetter font-header">TEACHING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS</h4>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                My experience as a Lead ESL Instructor has allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing curriculum for various age groups and ethnicities. I successfully completed the revamping of outdated curriculum for all grade levels of adult learners. Having experience as a busy instructor has motivated me to make the process of course development as easy as possible. 
            </p>
        
            <h4 class="ChangeClassGreen FirstLetter font-header">INFORMED BY DIVERSE STUDENTS</h4>
            <p class="Indent font-para">
                Having worked in both university and non-profit settings, I have had the privilege of working with a wide array of learning styles, age groups, and cultural backgrounds. These experiences have cultivated the strengths that I would bring to a digital learning team in higher education.
